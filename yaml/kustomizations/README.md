> Why can there only be one kustomization file in a kustomization directory?

In a Kubernetes Kustomize setup, a kustomization directory is designed to manage the configuration of Kubernetes resources in a structured and consistent way. The reason for having only one `kustomization.yaml` (or `kustomization.yml` or `Kustomization`) file per directory is to maintain clarity and simplicity in defining the transformation and customization of resources within that specific directory. Here are some key reasons:

1. **Single Source of Truth**: Having one kustomization file per directory ensures that there is a single source of truth for the customization logic applied to the resources in that directory. This reduces confusion and potential conflicts that could arise from multiple customization files.

2. **Simplicity and Organization**: It keeps the directory structure simple and organized. Each directory represents a specific layer or level of customization, and having one file simplifies understanding and managing the transformations applied at that level.

3. **Predictability**: It makes the behavior of the kustomization process predictable. When a user or tool processes a kustomization directory, it knows exactly where to look for the customization instructions.

4. **Ease of Use**: It simplifies the user experience by reducing the complexity involved in managing multiple kustomization files within the same directory. This makes it easier to apply and track changes.

5. **Tooling and Automation**: Many tools and scripts that work with Kustomize expect a single kustomization file per directory, which simplifies automation and integration processes.

By adhering to this convention, Kustomize ensures a consistent and efficient way to manage Kubernetes configurations.
