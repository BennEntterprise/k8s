# k8s
A repo of K8s files that I can use during my study as a DevOps engineer

This repo contains a bunch of k8s resources as yaml files that I can apply. And also some notes on various tooling. I was inspired by [The kubernetes Documentation Repo](https://github.com/kubernetes/website/tree/main/content/en/examples)

## Setup

``` bash
git clone https://github.com/bennentterprise/k8s
./scripts/setup.sh # sets the pre-commit hook
```
